Multi Cloud Management using AWS Systems Manager


With the more and more enterprises implementing a Multi Cloud strategy, there is a need for real time control and increased visibility. What if that need could be satisified through one single dashboard.

AWS Systems Manager was available to all customers of AWS to manage their IT operations using a single console. Recently, AWS made Systems Manager available on on-premise servers. My project is leverage the expansion to bare metal for use in a Multi Cloud environment. 

Though there are hybrid cloud management tools available in the market, especially those from IBM and MS, they aren't as inexpensive as Systems Manager.
